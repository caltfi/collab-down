(SNORES)

This is supposed to be a kids' show.

Sorry, Krusty.
Kids are no longer into your show.

Yeah, kids prefer TikTok, Instagram,

going to church, dentist appointments,
even getting bullied.

The only way we can get an audience

is to bring in loose seniors
who are lost at the mall.

We were lied to.

We were promised air conditioning.

There is air conditioning.

Turn it down! I'm freezing!

Okay, so maybe I did lose touch

with my audience in the ' s.

- What year is this?
- (WHISPERS)

and what?!
