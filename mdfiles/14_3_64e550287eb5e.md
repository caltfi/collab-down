They're buried where?!

(GROANS)

I tell you, Krusty,

the heyday of the TV clown ended

when parents found out that Ovaltine

was just sugared mud. (LAUGHS)

Everyone's gotten out.

Oingo, Boingo,

Penny Nickels, Knick Knack, Paddywhack,

the cast of The View,

Dungaree Dave, Sadsy.

Sad to see Sadsy go.

Oh, not Leaky Pants.

He'd never quit. He was born to it.

When his mother's water broke,
it was seltzer.

Cheese for your scampi?

Leaky? No!
